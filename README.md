## Deterministic Wallets ##

To run a deterministic wallet:

```$node crypto/wallet.js```

## Sorting out dependencies ##

when we use a dependency, we have to npm install it

but we can make this simpler by using a package.json file

which remembers the deps.

then, we can install all deps by running:

```$npm install```
