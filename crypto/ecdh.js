// for ECDH
// Alice has a private key and a public key (elliptic curve)
// Bob has a private key and a public key

// Alice gives Bob her public key
// Bob gives Alice his public key

// Somehow, magically, Alice and Bob will then 
// agree on the same secret,
// which they can then use to encrypt communications

// this is a KEY EXCHANGE
